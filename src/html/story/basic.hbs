  <p>Knowing that LaGuardia airport is under construction, Vaska Tsiolkovsky planned to arrive four hours in advance on Aug. 19 for his Air Canada flight to Toronto. It was a smart idea –– his terminal’s drop-off area was closed, his Uber ride cost $30 more after re-routing, and he sat in the traffic jam close to an hour.</p>
  <p>He ended up walking from the street to the terminal and had three hours to spare. But a thunderstorm delayed his flight for over two hours. He missed his connecting flight to Edmonton, his final destination, twice.</p>
  <p>“Our airline bumped us to a later flight to accommodate the delay but we missed that one as well,” Tsiolkovsky said. “We ended up traveling just under 24 hours.”</p>
  <p>The Port Authority’s four airports – John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International, LaGuardia and New York Stewart International airports – handled more passengers in June 2019 than any other June on record, reaching an all-time high of roughly 12.79 million passengers, up from 12.67 million last June.</p>
  <p>Record numbers of passengers, relentless thunderstorms and multiple runway closures have spurred more delays and cancellations at New York area airports in June than during the same time last year. According to the latest data from the US Department of Transportation, more flights were cancelled or delayed that month, while on-time performance rates went downhill across Newark, JFK and LaGuardia.</p>
