# Summer Delays in New York area airports

The Port Authority’s four airports – John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International, LaGuardia and New York Stewart International airports – handled more passengers in June 2019 than any other June on record, reaching an all-time high of roughly 12.79 million passengers, up from 12.67 million last June.

Record numbers of passengers, relentless thunderstorms and multiple runway closures have spurred more delays and cancellations at New York area airports in June than during the same time last year. According to the latest data from the US Department of Transportation, more flights were cancelled or delayed that month, while on-time performance rates went downhill across Newark, JFK and LaGuardia.
